# CDK Testing Strategies for AWS Infrastructure

When testing AWS CDK stacks, several testing approaches can be employed to ensure that infrastructure is defined correctly. Here are the key testing strategies for CDK stacks:

## 1. Snapshot Tests

Snapshot tests capture the CloudFormation template generated by the CDK stack and compare it against a saved version. This helps detect any unintended changes to the infrastructure.

```typescript
test('Stack matches snapshot', () => {
  const template = Template.fromStack(stack);
  expect(template.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

## 2. Fine-grained Assertions

These tests verify specific aspects of the generated CloudFormation template:

### Resource Existence
Verify that required resources are created:
```typescript
template.resourceCountIs('AWS::Lambda::Function', 1);
```

### Resource Properties
Verify that resources have the correct configurations:
```typescript
template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::Lambda::Function', {
  Runtime: 'nodejs20.x',
  Timeout: 30
});
```

### Resource Outputs
Verify that the stack exports the expected outputs:
```typescript
template.hasOutput('ApiEndpoint', {
  Description: 'Bedrock API endpoint URL'
});
```

## 3. Validation Tests

These verify that the CDK stack follows certain constraints or business rules:

```typescript
expect(() => {
  new MyStack(app, 'MyStack', { invalidProp: 'value' });
}).toThrow(/specific error message/);
```

## 4. Testing Inter-Resource Dependencies

Verify that resources are connected correctly:

```typescript
template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::ApiGateway::Method', {
  Integration: {
    Type: 'AWS_PROXY',
    IntegrationHttpMethod: 'POST'
  }
});
```

## Why CDK Testing is Important

1. **Early Feedback**: Catch infrastructure issues before deployment
2. **Prevention of Regressions**: Avoid unintended changes to infrastructure
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for expected infrastructure behavior
4. **Confidence in Changes**: Make changes with confidence that existing functionality is preserved
5. **Cost Control**: Avoid deploying misconfigured resources that could lead to unexpected costs

## Best Practices for CDK Testing

1. Test multiple aspects of your infrastructure, not just resource existence
2. Include IAM permission tests to ensure least privilege
3. Test both positive scenarios (resources created correctly) and negative scenarios (invalid configurations)
4. Keep tests focused on infrastructure definition, not runtime behavior
5. Use a combination of snapshot and fine-grained assertion tests

The tests implemented for the BedrockAPIStack follow these best practices by testing:
- The Lambda function's configuration
- IAM permissions granted to the Lambda function
- API Gateway configuration
- Integration between API Gateway and Lambda
- Stack outputs

These tests provide confidence that the infrastructure will be deployed correctly and with the expected configuration.
